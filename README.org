** Troubleshooting

*** elf.h file not found
    It is hard to get the header working with Mac OS to build
    kernel. For me, the file from this
    link(https://www.rockbox.org/tracker/task/9006) works
    well. (Direct link from the link:
    https://www.rockbox.org/tracker/task/9006?getfile=16683)

*** Error on SSL libraries
    To build kernel properly, we need to set proper INCLUDE paths by
    adding a path where openssl has been installed.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    KERNEL=kernel7 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf-
    HOSTCFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"  make
    #+END_SRC
